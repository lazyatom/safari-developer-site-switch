Safari Development Site Switch extension
=======================================================

When working on sites it's often convenient to toggle between the current page in production, and the same page in development. There have been many extensions like this in the past, but I couldn't find on for modern Safari, so I made one.

## Installing the extension

I don't (at the moment) have an Apple Developer Account, so I don't think I can package this up neatly, but I think you can still use it. Here's what I'd do:

* Clone this repository somewhere
* Open Safari
* Make sure that the "Develop" menu is enabled (in Safari Preferences -> Advanced)
* In the Develop menu from the menu bar, click "Show Extension Builder"
* In the Extension Builder window, click the little "+" in the bottom left and choose "Add Extension"
* Navigate to the directory of this repository, and click "Select"
* In the top right of the newly-added extension, click "Run"

I *think* that's it. You'll obviously want to customize the values if your setup is in any way different from me.

Hope that's useful!
